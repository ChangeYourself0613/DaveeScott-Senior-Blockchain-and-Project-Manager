We buy clothes online, import medicines from different parts of the world, and use remote financial and banking services. In such a scenario, where everything is available at your fingertips except the trust for the other party, how do you validate the authenticity of the clothes that you got online, or how do you know that the medicines you imported are genuine and not some cheap counterfeit or how do you know that your financial and personal data is safe and is not getting misused by some hacker sitting in some part of the world. There has always been a dire need for a system that can assure us that whatever we are buying is authentic, whatever data we are sharing is safe and secure.`,
